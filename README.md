Code for paper Rethinking the Image Fusion: A Fast Unified Image Fusion Network based on Proportional Maintenance of Gradient and Intensity.
This work uses the same network structure and the same form of loss function to realize infrared and visible image fusion, multi-exposure image fusion, medical image fusion, multi-focus image fusion and Pan-sharpening.
